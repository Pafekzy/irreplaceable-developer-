# L2E Irreplaceable Engineer

This repository documents my structured journey toward becoming an AI-native full-stack engineer with strong judgment, systems thinking, production awareness, and leadership capability.

The goal is not just to write code — but to develop the intellectual depth required to design resilient systems, build meaningful products, and contribute to Africa’s evolving tech landscape.

## 📖 Study Method

Each book is studied using a structured approach:

- Structured Notes (chapter-by-chapter understanding)
- Reflections (personal synthesis and insights)
- Applied Thinking (real-world applications)
- System Designs (architecture sketches & mental models)

---

## 🛠 Repository Structure

Each skill area has its own directory, and each book contains:

- `README.md` — book overview & objectives
- `notes.md` — detailed chapter notes
- `reflections.md` — distilled insights
- `applications.md` — practical implementations
- `/system-maps` — diagrams & conceptual breakdowns

---

## 🎯 Mission

To move from:

- Feature-thinking → System-thinking  
- Code-writing → Architecture-design  
- Execution → Judgment  

This is an evolving intellectual system — not just a reading log.
